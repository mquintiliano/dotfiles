# This file is the configuration file for all tools

# overrides all other storage.conf files. Container engines using the
# container/storage library do not inherit fields from other storage.conf
# files.
#
#  Note: The storage.conf file overrides other storage.conf files based on this precedence:
#      /usr/containers/storage.conf
#      /etc/containers/storage.conf
#      $HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf
#      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/containers/storage.conf (If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
# See man 5 containers-storage.conf for more information
# The "container storage" table contains all of the server options.
